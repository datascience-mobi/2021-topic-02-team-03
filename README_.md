Welcome to our project for skin specific TRAs in skin cancer! 


The final rmarkdown and pdf versions of our report are posted in this repository under the names: "FINAL_MARKDOWN.rmd" and "FINAL_REPORT.pdf".
The final presentation slides are saved in this repository under the name "FINAL_PRESENTATION.pdf".


The plots of our project are saved as .pdf files in the folder "plots". The tables needed for the TRA analysis can be found under the folder "TRA Daten". The "rawdata" folder contains the microarray raw data.
All the tables needed for the analysis in general can be accessed under the folder "tables" in this repository.
The folder "sessions" contains the .rda files. This includes the most important data frames we used in our analysis.
